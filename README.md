# JS Password Generator

## Description

My motivation for this program was to learn and practice javascript fundamentals.
This is built for generating a password based on the user's preference of length and use of various characters.

## Usage

To generate a password, click on the button labeled "Generate Password." A window will open on the screen prompting you to enter the length of your password (Use between 8 and 128 characters.)
A series of windows will then prompt you to select which characters you would like to use in your password. Options are uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You must choose at least one of these.
If all conditions are met, your password will generate in the page shown below.
